Have you verified your DNS setup?
Try the setting mdns off in /etc/host.conf.

EDIT:

It seems gentoo is handling this a bit different. To disable multicast DNS lookups, you have to change the file /etc/nsswitch.conf.
There should be something like:
hosts:          files mdns
Change it to:
hosts:          files dns


2. Edit your "/etc/ssh/ssh_config" and comment out these lines:
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
GSSAPIDelegateCredentials no

3. So in sshd_config on the server change this:
  #UseDNS yes
to this:
  UseDNS no
