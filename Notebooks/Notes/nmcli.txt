iwlist wlp3s0 scan

That will also show you whether your box sees your wifi network, and its networkname. If that works, you can add a connection with

nmcli conn add <parameters>

where for the specific parameters I suggest to consult the man page of nmcli. It will probably be something like:

nmcli conn add type wifi con-name <connectionname> ifname wlp3s0 ssid <wifinetworkname>

After that you can bring it up with

nmcli conn up <connectionname>




 nmcli con show
