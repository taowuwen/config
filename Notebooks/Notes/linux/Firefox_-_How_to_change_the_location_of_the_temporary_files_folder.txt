Changing the location of Firefox's temporary files folder can be useful when your PC is equipped with a small SSD (60GB). Moving the temporary folder to another drive will help to prevent frequent writing on the SSD.
Change the location of the temporary files folder
Create a folder on the drive you want to use and name it as: Firefox_temp

	Open Firefox.
	Type the following in the address bar: about:config
	Press enter to confirm
	Search for the following entry: browser.cache.disk.parent_directory
	If you can't find this entry, create it:
	Name it as: browser.cache.disk.parent_directory
	Right-click > New > String 

	A window opens, type the following:
		H:\\Firefox_temp\\

	Where H is the drive containing the new temporary folder.
	Close all windows and restart the browser.
	Clean your PC using CCleaner or Wise Disk cleaner.
	Given that the temporary files are now stored on another drive, some softwares won't be able to clear them.
	You can manually clear the temp folder by going to H:\\Firefox_temp\\
