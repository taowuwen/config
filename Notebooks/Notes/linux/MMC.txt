MMC/SDHC
Card
Readers
and
Gentoo
Linux

So, I had a need to use my SDHC card in my Dell Studio 17 (1737) notebook.  So, I set out to find out why it wasn't working.  I ended up finding out that I needed to load mmc_block and sdhci-pci in order to get it to work.  Here's what I did.

Kernel
Configuration

I happen to be using kernel 2.6.30, so your configuration may vary.

	<M> MMC/SD/SDIO card support  --->
	<M>   MMC block device driver
	[*] Use bounce buffer for simple hosts
	<M>   SDIO UART/GPS class support
	<M>   Secure Digital Host Controller Interface support
	<M>     SDHCI support on PCI bus

Gentoo
Module
Loading

Add the mmc_block and sdhci-pci modules to the configuration at /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6
Then I just loaded them by issuing...

	modprobe mmc_block
	modprobe sdhci-pci

My
System

For those searching on the internet, who might have the same MMC/SD chipsets as me.
