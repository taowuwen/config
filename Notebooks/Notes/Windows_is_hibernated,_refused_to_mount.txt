====== Windows is hibernated, refused to mount ======

	Windows is hibernated, refused to mount

Chances are that Windows really is hibernated. Windows does this automatically when you tell it to shutdown normally. The benefit is that you get a faster apparent start-up time.

To shutdown Windows without hybernating, issue the following at a command-prompt (in Windows):

shutdown /s

You might also want include /t 0 for immediate shutdown.

I found a nice tutorial to set up a launcher for this: How to Do a Full Shutdown in Windows 8 Without Disabling Hybrid Boot.



sudo ntfs-3g -o remove_hiberfile /dev/sdXN /path/to/mount
