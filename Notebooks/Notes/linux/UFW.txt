Ufw使用指南


>>> Installing (1 of 1) net-firewall/ufw-0.34_pre805-r2::gentoo

 
* To enable ufw, add it to boot sequence and activate it: 
* -- # rc-update add ufw boot 
* -- # /etc/init.d/ufw start 

* If you want to keep ufw logs in a separate file, take a look at 
* /usr/share/doc/ufw-0.34_pre805-r2/logging.  
* /usr/share/ufw/check-requirements script is installed.  
* It is useful for debugging problems with ufw. However one 
* should keep in mind that the script assumes IPv6 is enabled 
* on kernel and net-firewall/iptables, and fails when it's not.  
* Note: once enabled, ufw blocks also incoming SSH connections by 
* default. See README, Remote Management section for more information.  

>>> Recording net-firewall/ufw in "world" favorites file...
